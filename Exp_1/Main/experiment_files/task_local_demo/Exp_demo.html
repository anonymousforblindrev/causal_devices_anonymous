          On the following screen we will show you a drawing that will show a static snapshot of a dynamic situation that is about to unfold. 
          Your task will be to first study the scene and then decide what the outcome of that situation will be. 
          Then, on a subsequent scene, we'd like you to write a short description of the different steps in the situation that lead to this outcome. 
          We want you to write this text based on your intuitive understanding of the depicted scene.</p>

        <p>In the text you'll write, please be as concise and clear as possible.
